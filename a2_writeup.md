# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

It was difficult for me to keep track of what things applied to pind and what things applied to sind and I kept mixing up the two, resulting in errors. Additionally, it is hard because I know how to solve the problems but I am not familiar with the python to be able to write out the solution. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

You can use the match function to match the user input of the movie they are searching for and what they want to know about the movie to a database or source with the answer.
